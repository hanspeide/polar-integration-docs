## Polar SDK and API information

![Example Polar embedded poll](https://polar-production-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/pub-promo-addsite.png)

[Polar](http://polarb.com) polls can be integrated into your website or native app in several ways:
 
### Embed tag

We can provide you with a `<script>` or `<iframe>` tag that you can embed in your web page.  This tag will load a custom Javascript component that responsively renders the polls and handles user interaction such as voting and poll navigation.

[Embed tag documentation](/embed)

### HTTPS/JSON API

You can directly use Polar's HTTPS/JSON-based API to retreive poll data.  In this case, you would be responsible for rendering the polls and handling user interaction such as voting and poll navigation.

### Creating Polls

On the Polar website, you can create great-looking polls.  These polls can then be embedded on your site using the tools above.

You can also create sets of polls that can be embedded on your site.  With Poll Sets, when a user votes on one poll in a set, the next poll appears automatically.
