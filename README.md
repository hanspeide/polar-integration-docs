## Polar SDK and API documentation

![Example Polar embedded poll](https://polar-production-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/pub-promo-addsite.png)

[Polar](http://polarb.com) polls can be integrated into your website or native app in several ways:
 
#### Embed tag

With a `<script>` or `<iframe>` tag that you embed in your web page, we will responsively render your polls and handle all the user interaction such as voting and poll navigation.  We recommend this approach, as we've done all the hard work for you:

#### HTTPS/JSON API

If you prefer to handle the display and user interaction yourself, you can use Polar's HTTPS/JSON-based API to access the data directly.

[API documenation](/api/v4)

#### iOS SDK

With Polar's iOS SDK, you can integrate polls directly into your native iOS app.

### Getting the poll content

#### Types of things you can embed

You can embed either a single poll, or a set of polls ("poll set").   They look the same embedded in your site.  The only difference is a poll set will automatically transition to the next poll after the user votes.  A poll set is a great way to ask a series of related questions.

[Example of a single embedded poll](http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2013/11/05/the-5-best-reasons-for-buying-the-xbox-one-instead-of-a-ps4/)

#### Where do I get the polls and poll sets from?

It's easy to create your own great looking polls and poll sets on Polar.  But if you'd like to use some of the polls our community has [already made](http://polarb.com/polls), you can do that, too.   Either way, our "How To" will help you get started:

### Getting started

The first thing you should do is create a Polar account:

[http://polarb.com/join](http://polarb.com/join)

We recommend also creating a test account also, as a sandbox for your test content:

Next, check out the "How Tos" to start making some great-looking polls or poll sets:

Then, pick whichever of the integration methods above (embed code, API, iOS SDK) you prefer, and you're ready to start display Polar polls in your site.
