## Polar SDK and API information

![Example Polar embedded poll](https://polar-production-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/pub-promo-addsite.png)

[Polar](http://polarb.com) polls can be integrated into your website or native app in several ways:
 
### Embed tag

We can provide you with a `<script>` or `<iframe>` tag that you can embed in your web page.  This tag will load a custom Javascript component that responsively renders the polls and handles user interaction such as voting and poll navigation.

[Embed tag documentation](/embed/embed_component.md)

### HTTPS/JSON API

You can directly use Polar's HTTPS/JSON-based API to retreive poll data.  In this case, you would be responsible for rendering the polls and handling user interaction such as voting and poll navigation.

### iOS SDK

You can use Polar's iOS SDK to integrate polls into your native iOS app.
